## AWS WAF Security Automation - modular with Terraform

For more info/help, contact us: support@cerbo.io (http://cerbo.io)

This provides a modular way to deploy the WAF Reference Architecture (see bellow for image)
The key things about this (and comparison with the official Amazon
Cloud Formation) are:
* It is ridiculously fast - 6-8x faster than Amazon's Cloud Formation method
* It provides roll-back, undo, recovery, and clean delete abilities - all automatically
* It is modular (with Terraform)! This is extremely important. Any component can be replaced, extended, or integrated with something else. You can very easily re-purpose all of this (or any part) for a different AWS Automation project/purpose.

### Getting Started is very simple

First: Edit "amazon-cred-file.tf", and point to your AWS cred file, or set and export your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment variables.

Then, for each project/customer's CDN S3 bucket, run:

```


% ./waf --help
Usage: ./waf <customer> <s3-logs-bucket> <command>

<command> Options:
    create = create a new WAF setup for <customer>
    delete = delete a given <customer> WAF setup

Example: ./waf cerbo s3-bucket-name create
Example: ./waf customer01 s3-bucket-name delete
```

#### Cloud Formation for WAF Reference Architecture:
* The Cloud Formation "way" has many problems, one of which is that it's a single shot "all or nothing" approach.
* It is ridiculously slow. 
* This is mostly to compare to our automated deployment, and make sure everything is the same
